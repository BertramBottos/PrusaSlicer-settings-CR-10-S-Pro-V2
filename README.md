# PrusaSlicer-settings-CR-10-S-Pro-V2
This is my profile with settings for different filaments, for printing on my Creality CR-10 S Pro V2. 
As of now the profile only supports 
- Layer heights of: [0.08, 0.1, 0.12, 0.16, 0.2, 0.24, 0.28] [mm].
- Filament from: [Fiberlogy, ColorFabb, Spectrum, Filament PM].


PRINTER CALIBRATION:
When calibrating the retraction use the Printer Setting: "0.20mm Retraction Test", it wil output your retraction settings to you (*.gcode) file. 

Importing the slicer settings:
  1. Download the file: PrusaSlicer_config_bundle.ini
  2. Open PrusaSlicer
  3. Navigate to: File -> Import ->Import Config Bundle, and choose the confing Bundle file. 


For setting up the slicer I have attached the texture I use for the slicer. Notice that the file is not my own but Designed and Made by Lemon Orange.
To use a custom buildplate texture in the slicer you need to do the following:
  1. save the File (*.PNG or *.SVG)
  2. navigate to Printer Settings -> Bed Shape -> Set -> Load
  3. Chosse the apropiate file. 
For Convinience i reccoment to save the file under your slicer download: C:\Program Files\Prusa3D\PrusaSlicer\resources\profiles\Creality
